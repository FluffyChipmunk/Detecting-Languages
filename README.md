<h3>Detecting Languages</h3>

<h3>Abstract:</h3> 
We created a program that can guess what language a given sentence is in based on letter pair frequencies of languages in training texts. We used Don Quixote initially train the program. The program counts letter pairs in each language's Don Quixote. Then, it calculates the probability of a sentence appearing in that language by multiplying the probability of the sentence's letter pairs in the given language.
<h3>Project Files</h3>
<li>Language.java</li>
<li>Main.java</li> 
<li>TrainingTexts folder</li>
<h3>Software Needed</h3>
<li>IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.1 Ultimate Edition</li>
<li>Java 18.0.2.1</li>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
Upon opening the main, the user is given the option to create a language, load new text files into existing languages, display existing languages, or type in text to be identified. The latter feature is the bulk of the program, and can be used to identify what language the user is being “spoken,” or typed in.
